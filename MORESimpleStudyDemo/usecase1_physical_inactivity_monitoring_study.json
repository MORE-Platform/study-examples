{"study":{"studyId":12,"title":"Use Case 1: Physical Inactivity  monitoring  and  interventions ","purpose":"Physical Inactivity  monitoring  and  interventions.  Physical inactivity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by promoting obesity, unfavorable lipid profiles, and reduced cardiovascular fitness. Chronic stress contributes to CVD risk through elevated blood pressure, unhealthy coping behaviors, and the promotion of inflammation, all of which can harm the heart and blood vessels. Combining physical inactivity and chronic stress can compound these effects, further heightening the risk of heart disease. ","participantInfo":"Physical Inactivity  monitoring  and  interventions.
